AdventOfCode2020 in Kotlin

A bit f..d up setup:

- the whole Android project is here (in parallel with kotlin I am learning Android), so you have to dig up a bit for the main activity file
https://github.com/braginets/AdventOfCode2020/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/MainActivity.kt

- days are coming in commits, so in order to see specific day you have to look into the history
